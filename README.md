# Project Title: Network Packet Analyzer

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a tool that captures, analyzes, and visualizes network packets. This can help in monitoring network traffic, diagnosing issues, and ensuring network security by detecting anomalies or unauthorized traffic.

## Solution
Our network packet analyzer captures packets transmitted over a network, decodes the packet data, and presents the information in a user-friendly format. The tool includes features such as filtering packets based on protocols, IP addresses, and ports, as well as visualizing packet details to assist in troubleshooting network problems.

### Key Features:
- Packet Creation: Allows users to add packets with source, destination, priority, and size.
- Packet Deletion: Deletes packets and supports undo and redo functionality.
- Sorting: Sorts packets by priority.
- Search Functionality: Search for packets based on priority or source using a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- High Priority Packet Count**: Counts and displays packets that exceed a given priority threshold.
- Encryption: Packets are encrypted using XOR encryption for security.
