## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a tool that captures, analyzes, and visualizes network packets. This can help in monitoring network traffic, diagnosing issues, and ensuring network security by detecting anomalies or unauthorized traffic.

## Solution
Our network packet analyzer captures packets transmitted over a network, decodes the packet data, and presents the information in a user-friendly format. The tool includes features such as filtering packets based on protocols, IP addresses, and ports, as well as visualizing packet details to assist in troubleshooting network problems.
