Project Title: Sea Exploration - One Piece Inspired

## Problem Statement
Create a Program that allows for easy exploration of a graph based map, that has functionalities of exploration, optimal path finding and prioritization

## Solution
We create a graph data structure using an adjacency list of edges that hold their weights aswell as the destinations. The list of islands will be adjacent to this list and will hold the resource gain of the island to be visited. On this graph we apply functions such as explore, shortest path, adding graph node (siland with randomized edges and resource gains.
